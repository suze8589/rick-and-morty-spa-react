# Rick and Morty SPA

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The app fetches character data from the **Rick and Morty API** and allows users to view information about the characters from the animated series **Rick and Morty**.

The app is fully responsive, thanks to **Tailwind CSS**, and uses React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage and fetch the data.

## Features

- Display a list of characters from the Rick and Morty universe.
- Search characters by name.
- Paginate through the character list.
- Responsive and modern UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Fetching data using React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`).

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for custom styling.
- **Rick and Morty API**: A free API that provides data about characters, episodes, and locations from the Rick and Morty show.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation in the SPA (it's not used in this project, but it's a common choice for React apps).
